# Multiply Strings

Given two non-negative integers `num1` and `num2` represented as **strings**, return the **product** of `num1` and `num2`, also represented as a string.

> You must not use any built-in **BigInteger** library or convert the inputs to integers directly.

### Example 1

```text
Input: num1 = "2", num2 = "3"
Output: "6"
```

### Example 2

```text
Input: num1 = "123", num2 = "456"
Output: "56088"
```

### Constraints

- `1 <= num1.length, num2.length <= 200`
- `num1` and `num2` consist of digits only.
- Both `num1` and `num2` do **not** contain any leading zero, **except** for the number `"0"` itself.
